## Server Overview
This Express server integrates Firebase for user authentication and management. It supports Google Sign-In and Email/Password login through Firebase Authentication and manages user data using RESTful API endpoints. This server also interacts with a PostgreSQL database for various functionalities.

**Server Features**

- **User Management**: Create, read, update, and delete user profiles.
- **Authentication**: Manage user sessions using Firebase Authentication for Google Sign-In and Email/Password login. Authentication state managed using `express-session` and `passport.js`.
- **API Endpoints**: Manage user data through RESTful API endpoints for user profiles and settings. RESTful endpoints for user, team, match, badge, and basketball data management.
- **Error Handling**: Each route handles errors with appropriate HTTP status codes and messages.
- **Data Management**: Interact with PostgreSQL for data storage and retrieval. The routes rely on various query functions from `queries` files to interact with the database.

## Database Configuration

The application uses PostgreSQL and `pg-promise` for database interactions. The database configuration is defined in the `db.js` file as follows:
